### Cafe Network Project

This repository contains the Cisco Packet Tracer file for the Cafe Network Project, which simulates a modern cafe environment with a wireless network for customers.

### Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to design and implement a functional and secure network for a cafe. The network setup demonstrates key networking concepts, including dynamic IP addressing with **DHCP**, domain name resolution with **DNS**, and serving web content with **HTTP**.

### Features
* **Wireless Connectivity:** A single wireless router provides network access.
* **Smartphones:** Two smartphones are configured to connect to the wireless network.
* **Server:** A server is set up to host the cafe's menu.
* **DHCP Configuration:** The wireless router is configured as a **DHCP server** to automatically assign IP addresses to the smartphones.
* **DNS Configuration:** A **DNS record** on the server translates the domain name `www.cafe.com` to its IP address.
* **Web Hosting:** An **HTML file** for the cafe's menu is hosted on the server, accessible via the URL `www.cafe.com`.

### Devices and Technologies
* **Wireless Router:** 1
* **Smartphones:** 2
* **Server:** 1
* **Protocols:** DHCP, DNS, HTTP
